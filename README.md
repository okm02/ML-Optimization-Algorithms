# ML-Optimization-Algorithms

Most optimization researchers tend to proof convergence analysis of existing or new algorithms.These theoretical analysis include smart selection of learning rates to obtain faster convergence results. However , these results might not work in practice. This project is inteneded prove that theoretical aspects in this field do work in practice.
